# Project with Inversify, Bun, and Hono

This project uses **Inversify**, **Bun**, and **Hono** to build a modular, fast, and lightweight application. The purpose of this project is to create a framework similar to **NestJS**, but much simpler, focusing on modularity, dependency injection, and high performance.

## Technologies Used

### Inversify
Inversify is an inversion of control (IoC) container for TypeScript and JavaScript. It allows efficient dependency management, facilitating dependency injection and promoting a modular and scalable design.

### Bun
Bun is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that includes a package manager, a development server, and an ultra-fast execution environment. It is an alternative to Node.js with a focus on performance.

### Hono
Hono is an ultra-lightweight web framework for building fast applications and APIs. It is designed to be minimalist and efficient, ideal for projects requiring high performance.

## Start the Application in Development Mode

1. Make sure you have **Bun** installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions at [https://bun.sh](https://bun.sh).
2. Run the following command to start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

# Copilot Templates

This project includes specific templates to help GitHub Copilot and developers maintain code quality and consistency.

Templates are located at:

- `.github/copilot/`

For example, for unit tests, see:

- `.github/copilot/UNIT_TEST_TEMPLATE.md`

These templates contain requirements, examples, and best practices that must be followed when developing and testing the project.
